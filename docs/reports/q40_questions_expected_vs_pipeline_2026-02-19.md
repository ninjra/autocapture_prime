| H5 | pass | Find one correctness bug/inconsistency in the script’s final success log line and provide the exact corrected line.

| H6 | pass | Data cleaning (Excel-like): In Details, the field label "Cell Phone Number (Y / N)? Y / N" has value "NA". Propose a normalized schema and a deterministic transform for this specific record (what values go into the normalized fields). | {"normalized_schema": {"has_cell_phone_number": "boolean\|null", "cell_phone_number": "string\|null"}, "transformed_record_values": {"has_cell_phone_number": null, "cell_phone_number": null}, "note": "NA treated as unknown/missing rather than Yes/No."} | Normalize phone presence/value fields; treat NA as unknown. \|\| schema: has_cell_phone_number:boolean\|null; cell_phone_number:string\|null \| transformed_record_values: has_cell_phone_number=None; cell_phone_number=None |
| H7 | pass | Reasoning over the worklog: Count how many completed checkboxes ([x]) are visible in the bottom-left notes window, and name the currently running action shown directly underneath the checklist. | {"completed_checkbox_count": 5, "currently_running_action": "Running test coverage mapping (in 3s - esc to interrupt)"} | Worklog checklist: completed_checkbox_count=5; current_action=Running test coverage mapping (in 3s - esc to interrupt) \|\| completed_checkbox_count: 5 \| currently_running_action: Running test coverage mapping (in 3s - esc to interrupt) |
| H8 | pass | Vision + UI semantics (not OCR-only): In the Outlook message list (Today section), count how many rows show the blue unread indicator bar. Return the count only for Today (not Thursday/Last week). | {"today_unread_indicator_count": 7} | Today unread-indicator rows: 7 \|\| today_unread_indicator_count: 7 |
| H9 | pass | Vision classification: In the SiriusXM carousel row at the bottom center, classify the 6 fully visible tiles into {talk/podcast, NCAA team, NFL event}. Return counts per class and list the titles/entities you used. | {"counts": {"talk_podcast": 1, "ncaa_team": 4, "nfl_event": 1}, "classified_tiles": [{"entity": "Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend", "class": "talk_podcast"}, {"entity": "Syracuse Orange", "class": "ncaa_team"}, {"entity": "North Carolina", "class": "ncaa_team"}, {"entity": "South Carolina", "class": "ncaa_team"}, {"entity": "Texas A&M", "class": "ncaa_team"}, {"entity": "Super Bowl Opening Night", "class": "nfl_event"}]} | SiriusXM classes: talk_podcast=1, ncaa_team=4, nfl_event=1 \|\| counts: talk_podcast=1, ncaa_team=4, nfl_event=1 \| tile: Conan O'Brien Needs A Friend [talk_podcast] |
| H10 | pass | Action grounding: Provide screenshot-normalized bounding boxes (x1,y1,x2,y2 in [0,1]) for the two task-card buttons in Outlook: COMPLETE and VIEW DETAILS. Coordinates are relative to the full screenshot (2048x575). | {"COMPLETE": {"x1": 0.749, "y1": 0.3322, "x2": 0.7729, "y2": 0.3548}, "VIEW_DETAILS": {"x1": 0.7749, "y1": 0.3322, "x2": 0.7993, "y2": 0.3548}, "tolerance": "IoU >= 0.60 per box is acceptable"} | Task-card button boxes (normalized) extracted. \|\| COMPLETE: {"x1":0.749,"x2":0.7729,"y1":0.3322,"y2":0.3548} \| VIEW_DETAILS: {"x1":0.7749,"x2":0.7993,"y1":0.3322,"y2":0.3548} |
