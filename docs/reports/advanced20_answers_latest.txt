Q: Cross-window reasoning: Slack mentions running a "new converter" at two sizes. Identify those two numbers from Slack, then infer the best-matching parameter in the dev note (k vs dimension). Finally, produce two example GET query strings using k=64 and those two values as the inferred parameter.
