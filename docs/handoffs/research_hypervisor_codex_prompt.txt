Implement migration of research subsystem from autocapture_prime into hypervisor.

Use source files from:
/mnt/d/projects/autocapture_prime/autocapture/research/
/mnt/d/projects/autocapture_prime/plugins/builtin/research_default/

Requirements:
1) Hypervisor becomes sole owner of research runtime.
2) Research runs only during idle windows.
3) Preserve report contract:
   - ok
   - reports[] containing source_id, items, diff, cache_hit, report_hash
   - ran_at
4) Persist to hypervisor data root under research/cache and research/reports.
5) Add metrics:
   - runs_total
   - last_run_utc
   - changed_items_total
   - cache_hit_ratio
6) Add tests:
   - watchlist filtering
   - threshold diff behavior
   - idle-only scheduling
   - report schema stability

After implementation:
- print changed files
- print test command and result
- print any follow-up required in autocapture_prime (should be none)
