Okay, let's see. The user wants the EFFECTIVE_PROMPT rewritten to improve grounding and clarity. The original prompt was causing a JSON parse error, so the model's output didn't match the expected structure. The main issues were that the evidence array had only one item instead of two, and the text wasn't exact.

First, I need to make sure the rewritten prompt clearly specifies that the evidence array must have exactly two items. The keys for each evidence item should be 'kind' and 'text', with 'text' being the exact highlighted text. Also, the prompt should emphasize prioritizing evidence from the active Outlook task/incident row and the reading-pane title if available.

I should structure the JSON output strictly, ensuring no markdown or extra text. The keys 'focused_window' and 'evidence' must be present, with 'evidence' being an array of two objects. The model's output example had only one evidence item, so the prompt needs to enforce exactly two.

Also, the original prompt mentioned "strict JSON only" and "no markdown fences and no extra text." The rewritten prompt should reinforce that the output must be a single JSON object without any additional formatting.

Let me check if I covered all points: correct JSON structure, exact
