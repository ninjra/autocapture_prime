Return strict JSON only with key "windows" as an ordered array where each item has "active_title", "hostname", and "tab_count". Output only a single JSON object with no markdown fences and no extra text.

Answer this exact question context when extracting: For each visible browser window in the screenshot, extract the active tab title, the address-bar hostname (hostname only), and the count of visible tabs in that window’s tab strip.

Use only visible evidence from the image.

Answer policy:
- Prefer correctness over speed.
- Use only grounded evidence from provided context.
- If evidence is insufficient, explicitly return indeterminate.
