Okay, let's tackle this. The user wants me to rewrite the EFFECTIVE_PROMPT to improve grounding and clarity while keeping the user intent the same. The original prompt is about extracting a timeline from a task/incident view, specifically the 'Record Activity' timeline entries with their timestamps and text in order. The error mentioned is a budget exhaustion, so maybe the model had trouble processing the request as is.

First, I need to understand what "grounding" means here.

2. Extract 'Record Activity' timeline entries in top-to-bottom order.
3. Preserve exact
